# TypeRacer Game

A real-time multiplayer typing game built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and WebSockets.

ðŸ‘‰ **Play it here:** [ðŸš€ TypeRacer Live Game](https://typeracer-eight.vercel.app/)

Since Render free tier spins the backend server down after not being used for some time, the app will not work correctly until the backend server wakes up.
If the game doesn't work try again in 30 seconds.
